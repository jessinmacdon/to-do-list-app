# to-do-list-app
## mini project

creation of a small to-do-list app using jquery.

This app enables the user to log and track thier activities. They are able to do the following:
- ***add an item to the list*** 
- ***delete an item from the list*** 
- ***mark item as done (by striking it on the list)*** 
- ***and sort the list (reorder items on the list)***
 
Since this app was built with a focus on functionality, minimum attention was paid to the UI elements therefore only the basic UI elements were implemented on this  mini-project.
